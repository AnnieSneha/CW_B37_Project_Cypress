# ADD TO CART FUNCTIONALITY(CYPRESS)

## Introduction
### Overview
This project aims to automate the "Add to Cart" functionality on the TutorialsNinja demo e-commerce website using Cypress, a powerful JavaScript-based end-to-end testing framework. The automation script will simulate a user searching for a product, adding it to the cart, and verifying the addition. The project will follow best practices by using the Page Object Model (POM) to organize test code and ensure maintainability.

### Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate the ability to automate common e-commerce interactions, which are essential for functional testing of web applications. By automating the "Add to Cart" process, we can ensure that this crucial functionality works correctly, enhancing the reliability and user experience of the website.

### Core Functionality
1. Search for a Product: Enter a product name into the search box and initiate the search.
2. Select Product: Click on the desired product from the search results.
3. Add to Cart: Add the selected product to the shopping cart.
4. Verify Addition: Ensure that the product has been successfully added to the cart by checking the shopping cart.
   
### Problems Solved
1. Automated Testing: Reduces the need for repetitive manual testing, saving time and effort.
2. Consistency: Ensures consistent test execution, minimizing human errors.
3. Early Bug Detection: Identifies issues early in the development cycle, improving the overall quality of the application.
4. Tools and Technologies

Programming Language: JavaScript
